* Should I hack all servers, no matter their hacking requirement? Currently only do it if 1/3 of my level. All servers with < X time to hack?

* Upgrade purchase-server to handle < max servers case
** purchase 1 at a time until max

* add stock helper to get all stock servers

* Upgrade run-money-maker
** For each hackable server that isn't stock
*** Find ideal threadcount for most expensive of hack/grow
*** Find servers with 100% hack chance?
*** Find most powerful startable server with that many free threads
*** run money-maker on that server

* Build connect to server script
** Given a server, find a path and connect

* Upgrade startup to dynamically enable scripts based on memory rather than a static 1024

* upgrade purchase-programs to only buy programs if they are currently useful (eg: buying the program would allow me to nuke a new server)
